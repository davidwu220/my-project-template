# My React Template

My personal web app template. The purpose of this repo is to setup a barebone framework that has all the tools one needs to start coding their React app yet not overloaded with packages that would confuse a newbie.

- Webpack 4 is used to bundle and transpile scss, jsx to distribution folder and is loaded with a HTML template.

- babel 7 is used to transpile ES6, 7, and React into ES5 for better browser compatibilities.
